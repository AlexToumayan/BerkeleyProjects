# My Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my projects repository. This repository is a compilation of the extensive work I have undertaken during my time at Berkeley, showcasing my practical experience and technical expertise in software development. The projects span from data analysis tools to game development, demonstrating my versatility as a developer. These projects are primarily developed in Java, with components involving JavaScript and HTML for front-end development. I am excited to present to you the various aspects of my skills, ranging from Java, procedural generation, data structure implementation, algorithm development and more. 

## Project 1: NGordnet (NGrams)

**Objective:** This project revolves around the design and implementation of a data analysis tool that allows users to explore the historical usage of words in English texts.

**Description:** NGordnet is an interactive interface for linguistic research and analysis, developed using Java for backend processing and JavaScript and HTML for frontend interactions. 

**Key Features:**
- Efficient management and analysis of vast linguistic data using robust data structures.
- Follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for maintainability and scalability.
- Compatible with multiple versions of Java (v15 and above).
- Detailed documentation and user guide for easy tool onboarding and utilization.

## Project 2: NGordnet (Wordnet)

**Objective:** The second phase of the NGordnet project integrates semantic understanding into the mix, adding more complexity and depth to the linguistic tool.

**Description:** Project 2 expands on Project 1 by integrating WordNet, a lexical database for English, for semantic analysis. This phase of the project involves more complex data structures, algorithms and language processing techniques.

**Key Features:**
- Semantic understanding of words enabled through the integration of WordNet.
- Feature that finds and displays hyponyms of a word, enhancing the tool's understanding of word relationships.
- Optimal performance via data parsing: reads the entire input file once and ensures fast response times for subsequent calls.
- Implements complex algorithms for data analysis and graph traversal to provide semantic relationships between words.

## Project 3: BYOW (Build Your Own World)

**Objective:** The third project is a tile-based, 2D world generation game, which demonstrates the usage of procedural generation techniques.

**Description:** BYOW is a unique, interactive 2D world created using Java. The game starts by rendering a randomly generated world, allowing players to interact within it. 

**Key Features:**
- Procedural generation techniques create unique, interactive 2D worlds.
- Implementation of keyboard interactivity for a seamless user experience.
- Save and load functionality for preserving game states.
- Efficient rendering and interactions within the game world through extensive use of data structures and algorithms.

## Final Thoughts

These projects collectively demonstrate my skills in Java, procedural generation, data structure implementation, and algorithm development, among others. I have made sure to adhere to best software development practices and have worked diligently to achieve efficient memory management. All of these projects adhere to the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and I believe they would be a great way for potential employers to understand my capabilities as a developer. Feel free to explore this repository to see my work in more detail.
