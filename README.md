# Berkeley Projects

### Project 2a: NGordnet (NGrams)

This project involves the design and implementation of a data analysis tool that allows users to explore the history of word usage in English texts. It is primarily developed in Java and includes JavaScript and HTML for the front-end elements. The tool accepts user input and generates corresponding outputs for display, providing an interactive interface for linguistic research and analysis.

Key Features:
- Rich usage of data structures to efficiently manage and analyze the vast amounts of linguistic data.
- Developed following the principles of OOP for maintainability and scalability.
- Ensures compatibility with multiple versions of Java (v15 and above).
- Detailed documentation and user guide for easy onboarding and utilization of the tool.

### Project 2b: NGordnet (Wordnet)

Project 2b is an extension of Project 2a where we go beyond mere exploration of word usage and start integrating semantic understanding into the mix. The project involves reading and analyzing WordNet, a lexical database for English, and integrating it with the initial tool from Project 2a. It involves significantly more complex data structures and algorithms, as well as a deep understanding of language processing and manipulation.

Key Features:
- Semantic understanding of words through the integration of WordNet, enabling a deeper analysis of word usage.
- Developed a feature that finds and displays hyponyms of a word, thus enhancing the tool's ability to understand word relationships.
- Data parsing for optimal performance: The tool reads the entire input file only once and ensures fast response times for subsequent calls.
- Involves complex algorithms for data analysis and graph traversal to provide semantic relationships between words.

### Project 3: BYOW (Build Your Own World)

Project 3 is a tile-based, 2D world generation game developed in Java. The game begins by rendering a randomly generated world and allows players to interact with this environment by moving around the world, opening doors, and unveiling hidden rooms. It leverages procedural generation techniques to create a unique world with each new game. 

Key Features:
- Utilization of procedural generation techniques to create unique, interactive 2D worlds.
- Implementation of keyboard interactivity for a seamless user experience.
- Save and load functionality for preserving game states.
- Extensive usage of data structures and algorithms to ensure efficient rendering and interactions within the game world.

These projects demonstrate skills in Java, procedural generation, data structure implementation, algorithm development, and more. They showcase a deep understanding of OOP principles, efficient memory management, and software development best practices. 

Note: The source code for these projects is proprietary and not publicly accessible. Please get in touch if you would like a code walkthrough or additional details on the project implementations.
